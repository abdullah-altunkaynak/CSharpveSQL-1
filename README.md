# CSharpveSQL-1


* CSharp ADO.NET Repository Pattern Example

This project is a clean and well-structured **C# Console Application** that demonstrates how to access a SQL Server database using **ADO.NET**, applying **Repository Pattern** and **Layered Architecture** principles.

The project uses the **AdventureWorksDW2022** database and focuses on writing maintainable, testable, and professional data access code.

---

** Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate:

- Clean ADO.NET usage with `SqlDataReader`
- Separation of concerns using layered architecture
- Repository Pattern implementation
- Proper SQL-to-C# object mapping
- Secure and parameterized SQL queries
- Configuration-based connection string management

This project is intentionally kept simple to focus on **architecture and best practices** rather than UI complexity.
